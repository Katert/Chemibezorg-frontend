# Chemibezorg Front-end
For a job interview, I had to write a simple web application (both front- and back-end) for a fictional company called Chemibezorg.
This company delivers chemical products. An employee who plans shipments, should receive a warning when specific products are combined in the same shipment, 
because of various dangers.

# TODO

- Implement conditions to check for forbidden ingredients instead of products (also for back end).
- Set disabled button to false when there are no forbidden combinations.
- Create modal with shipment details when user clicks on 'Show' in 'Overview shipments'.
- Design user login form.

# Stack
This front-end is built with React.js.

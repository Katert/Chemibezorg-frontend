# Chemibezorg Back-end
For a job interview, I had to write a simple web application (both front- and back-end) for a fictional company called Chemibezorg.
This company delivers chemical products. An employee who plans shipments, should receive a warning when specific products are combined in the same shipment, 
because of various dangers.

# Stack
This front-end is built with React.js.
